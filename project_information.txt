Roadmap:
* Step 1: Get this running
    * set up an "application" with the Google Drive API
        // https://developers.google.com/drive/web/quickstart/js#step_1_enable_the_api_name
* Step 2: Convert the existing application to angular
    * A routing config that will have 2 views, a list (or index) and a document view
        // each of those routes are (probably) going to need a controller
    * A Google Drive Service to handle all of the calls
        // remember to mock all usage of $http with $httpBackend
    * A directive to handle the oauth button
    * A service to hold on to the CLIENT_ID and SCOPES for use in the Google Drive Service.
* Step 3
    * Translate the text
        * Establish a service for the public API at http://ancient-anchorage-9224.herokuapp.com/zombify?q=zombify
        * Testing this service should use $httpBackend.
* Step 4: Testing
    // Any controller, directive, or service will need tests associated with it.
    // don't test whether the API is working. Mock it.
    // Don't test services through the controllers, test one thing at a time.
* Rubric
    * Created a client ID
    * Use of routing
        * For at least the two views: list and document
    * Use of directive
        * for at least the oauth button
    * Use of service for gdata
    * Use of service for ztranslator
    * Testing
        * controllers, directives and services.
