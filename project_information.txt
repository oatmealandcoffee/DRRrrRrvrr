"to get the file list to work, I decoupled the authorization from the list loading functionality, and that seems to help. I also had to use the $q service (not covered or even mentioned in class) to manage thread control (I don't like callback rainbows), and at least one $scope.$digest();"

"I did a couple of things different then what you seem to have done. 
* I decoupled the listFiles callback from the auth callback. The handleAuthResult just sets an isAuthorized variable on my service. 
	* Instead I watched for the my isAuthorized variable to change then fetch the files in my controllers (list and document). 
	* This gave me a little more control over how things were happening, although I'm sure there's other (possibly cleaner) ways to do it as well. 
* I also had to use $rootScope.$apply in a few places in order to get things to update (see other posts in this thread). 
* Your check auth using the interval should just move into the directive definition. 
	* Take a look at the example from the module videos http://plnkr.co/edit/kwW5BuWERrbIcfWF948h?p=preview (Links to an external site.) on how to do that. 
* You don't need the window.action because that's being handled with angular routes. 
* As for testing, I just mocked all of the google auth/client code and utilize callbacks (see other posts in this thread). 
X As for the 403, looks like you've exceeded your auth attempts... you might be able to create new credentials to get around that or wait a day."

Roadmap:
X Step 1: Get this running
    X set up an "application" with the Google Drive API
        // https://developers.google.com/drive/web/quickstart/js#step_1_enable_the_api_name
* Step 2: Convert the existing application to angular
    * A routing config that will have 2 views, a list (or index) and a document view
        // each of those routes are (probably) going to need a controller
    * A Google Drive Service to handle all of the calls
        // remember to mock all usage of $http with $httpBackend
    * A directive to handle the oauth button
    * A service to hold on to the CLIENT_ID and SCOPES for use in the Google Drive Service.
* Step 3
    * Translate the text
        * Establish a service for the public API at http://ancient-anchorage-9224.herokuapp.com/zombify?q=zombify
        * Testing this service should use $httpBackend.
* Step 4: Testing
    // Any controller, directive, or service will need tests associated with it.
    // don't test whether the API is working. Mock it.
    // Don't test services through the controllers, test one thing at a time.
* Actionable Step 2: Convert existing app to angular
	X get gulp up to date with all the frameworks
	X where is google docs api loaded ion routastic?
	X fix jshint errors
	X get karma up to date with all the frameworks
    X Create CLIENT_ID and SCOPES service
    > Create directive for oauth button // see Week-10-solution
        X include in index.html as button
        X Use GoogleDriveService as controller
        X Move init code in head of HTML into controller or service
        X load google drive api in head or in service
        [@
            <script>
                function init() {
                    gapi.client.load('drive', 'v2');
                }
            </script>
            <script src="https://apis.google.com/js/client.js?onload=init"></script>
            <script src="vendor.js"></script>
            <script src="app.js"></script>
        @]
        X add window.checkAuth to oauth button directive
        > Update view with $rootScope.apply() // see discussions
        	* GoogleDriveService.asyncGetList.promise.success is where the files get loaded, but then the code needs to get called to add it to the view. Somehow the loading of the gapi needs to be called when the view is loaded, and the list of files returned.
        		* ListController.handleAuthClick kicks off the process, so the list needs to be returned at that point.
        X Update oauth directive to use $interval for the interval-ed checkAuth code that updates isAuthorized in controller(? we need to inject controller? No, that's not right)
        X Add isAuthorized variable for list fetch to check before fetching
        	// the goal is to decouple the auth from the list files
        - $q service may need to be used to manage async

    X Create Google Drive Service // see routastic
        X Migrate app.js code
        X inject client/scopes service
    X Create list controller // see app.js; requires oauth directive, Google
        * Add oauth directive
    X Create document view controller // see app.js; requires oauth directive
     * Create routing config // see Routastic
        * Merge doc.html and index.html common code
        * Create list.html view
        * Create doc.html view
        * Updated index.html to use ng-view
    * Test file list loading
    * Handle document loading
    	* use Routing config
    		* update doc.html to /doc
    	* use oauth for loading
    		* get id from URL
    		* Beware of having to load the API a second time
    * Update client id and scopes service to pull from server // see routastic
    * Tests
    	* should get list of files from google api
    	* should list all the files in the DOM
    	* should get a file when link clicked
    	* should display contents of file
    * I $watch files in my listController and call $digest inside the function that captures them. I also don't use appendLink function, I use ng-repeat and directives to grab file id and create link in my list template. 
* Step 3: Translate the text
    * Create service for the public API
    * inject service into document view controller
* Rubric
    X Created a client ID
    X Use of routing
        X For at least the two views: list and document
    X Use of directive
        X for at least the oauth button
    X Use of service for gdata
    * Use of service for ztranslator
    * Testing
        * controllers, directives and services.
