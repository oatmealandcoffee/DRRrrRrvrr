Bugs:

Roadmap:
X Step 1: Get this running
    X set up an "application" with the Google Drive API
        // https://developers.google.com/drive/web/quickstart/js#step_1_enable_the_api_name
* Step 2: Convert the existing application to angular
    * A routing config that will have 2 views, a list (or index) and a document view
        // each of those routes are (probably) going to need a controller
    * A Google Drive Service to handle all of the calls
        // remember to mock all usage of $http with $httpBackend
    * A directive to handle the oauth button
    * A service to hold on to the CLIENT_ID and SCOPES for use in the Google Drive Service.
* Step 3
    * Translate the text
        * Establish a service for the public API at http://ancient-anchorage-9224.herokuapp.com/zombify?q=zombify
        * Testing this service should use $httpBackend.
* Step 4: Testing
    // Any controller, directive, or service will need tests associated with it.
    // don't test whether the API is working. Mock it.
    // Don't test services through the controllers, test one thing at a time.
* Actionable Step 2: Convert existing app to angular
    * Create CLIENT_ID and SCOPES service
    * Create directive for oauth button // see Week-10-solution
        * include in index.html
    * Create Google Drive Service // see routastic
        * Migrate app.js code
        * inject client/scopes service
        * add button to index.html for oauth
    > Create list controller // see app.js; requires oauth directive, Google Drive Service
        * add Google Drive service
        * Add oauth directive
    > Create document view controller // see app.js; requires oauth directive Google Drive Service
        * add Google Drive service
        * Add oauth directive
    * Create routing config // see Routastic
        * '/list'
        * '/doc'
        * Merge doc.html and index.html common code
        * Create doc.html and list.html views
    * Create client id and scopes service // see routastic

    * Tests
* Step 3: Translate the text
    * Create service for the public API
    * inject service into document view controller
* Rubric
    X Created a client ID
    * Use of routing
        * For at least the two views: list and document
    * Use of directive
        * for at least the oauth button
    * Use of service for gdata
    * Use of service for ztranslator
    * Testing
        * controllers, directives and services.
